# My personal ZMK Layout (wireless Corne 5x3 + 3)

This project is heavily 'inspired' by urob's [zmk-config](https://github.com/urob/zmk-config.git).
I found it when trying to make my first baby-steps with homerow-mods. Since then, I'm having a lot of
fun playing around and 'finding things out'... 

## Layout Decisions

### QWERTY
I decided to use QWERTY for the main layout, because I use VIM and the commandline a lot, which in their standard
configurations are somewhat dependent on QWERTY (e.g. hjkl for movement...). 
Also, I wanted to flatten the learning curve a little bit. 

### macOS
This layout is made for macOS. Urob's Keymap is made for Windows, so I had to change the layout
of the homerow-mods to suit my needs as a macOS user.
